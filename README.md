Create logs with python.

If you want to create logs, and you don't want unnecessary:
- plus code,
- debuging,
and if you want a standardized way.

To get started, [download the latest version](https://github.com/koviubi56/logcreator/releases/latest), import it (`import logcreator`), and use it (`logcreator.log({"type", "text", "return"})`)
